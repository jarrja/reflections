When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Having backup plans and data is always better. Moreover you can work
    remotely with any device you have without worrying about drive.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    That decision should be made manually where some changes you might don't
    want to pull from the github.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking copies the original repository on github and put it in your
    github. Cloning can working locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So we can work remotely.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    That would be harder. Git and Github provides tools for easy collaborating
    and easy to check the difference.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    To make sure that my change can be collaborated in to master branch
    without any conflict and also to let people collaborating with the
    project see the changes first.
